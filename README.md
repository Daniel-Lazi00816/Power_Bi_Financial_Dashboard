# Power_Bi_Financial_Dashboard


## Introduction:
	
With the bevy of data at our fingertips and a passion for Power_Bi, I wanted to show what I could do by creating a dashboard that would take in my personal day-to-day spending data and make sense of it in an interesting way. 

There are a few things I hope that this dashboard will show. The first being expense percentage and savings percentage, month over month, year over year to my total income. 
	
Then I want to create a graph that shows how those two metrics saving percentage and expense percentage stack up in a trend line graph to the overall change in my income changes. 
	
## Project Status 11/17/2022:

As of 11/17/2022 being able to successfully categorize all expenses in a way that is illustrative. Going forward I will begin to better categorize all of my savings between cash and mutual funds.

However, some things still need to be ironed out, in particular I need to get my net income calculator DAX formula working and polish off the trend line which compares saving percentage, expense percentage to changes in my income.
